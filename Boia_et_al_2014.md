# Acquiring Commonsesne Knowledge for Sentiment Analysis using Human Computation

They consider the task of sentiment analysis : the most successful methods use independent words as text features, typically by adding word polarity scores from sentiment lexicons. With such methods, models can reach 60-80% while humans level reach around 90%. Some words have the same polarity in every context but others ar ambiguous and their polarities vary in defferent contexts. 

When texts are treated as sets of independent words, context is lost.

The authors propose a game to obtain contextual knowledge with human computation.
