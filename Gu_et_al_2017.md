# Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks for Aspect-Based Opinion Summary

This paper focuses on online reviews analysis.

This paper takes a line different from prior work on aspect extraction: directly mapping each review sentence into pre-defined aspect categories.
Sentences has to be manually labelled with a set of aspects among predifined ones and sentiments.
