# Generating Text via Adversarial Training

The authors propose a generic framework employing LSTM and CNN for adversarial training to generate realistic text.

The CNN is the discriminator, used for sentence encoding. The LSTM is used as generated which translate a latent vector into the synthetic sentence.
